Implement the next step of the current plan.

This command is for plans that have been broken into discrete step files (via `/plan:break`). It implements one step at a time, marks it complete in the plan's checklist, and records what was done in the step file's Summary section.

0. **Choose the plan** — if a specific plan is obvious from the conversation context, use that. Otherwise list the 5 most recent files in `docs/plans/new/` (by modification time) and present them as a numbered menu for the user to choose from. Wait for the user's selection before continuing.

1. **Read the plan and find the next step** — read the chosen plan file from `docs/plans/new/`. Locate the `## Implementation Steps` checklist at the top of the file. Find the first unchecked item (`- [ ]`). If every item is already checked (`- [x]`), stop and tell the user the plan is fully implemented.

2. **Confirm with the user** — show the user which step is next (its number, title, and step file path) and ask them to confirm before proceeding. Wait for confirmation.

3. **Read the step file** — read the specific step file referenced by the next unchecked checklist item (e.g. `docs/plans/<plan-name>/<N>-<slug>.md`).

4. **Create a todo list** — use TodoWrite to break the step into discrete tasks, then work through them one by one, marking each complete as you go.

5. **Write tests** — add or update unit tests and smoke tests for every new or changed function as described in the step.

6. **Verify** — once all tasks for this step are done, run `/verify` to confirm the full test suite and compile checks pass.

7. **Update the step file's Summary** — replace the empty `## Summary` placeholder at the bottom of the step file with a concise account of what was actually done: files changed, key decisions, anything that diverged from the original step instructions, and anything deferred.

8. **Mark the step complete** — in the plan file's Implementation Steps checklist, change the `- [ ]` for this step to `- [x]`.

9. **If this was the last step, move the plan** — if every item in the Implementation Steps checklist is now `- [x]`, move the plan file and its steps directory from `docs/plans/new/` to `docs/plans/done/`. Otherwise leave the plan in `new/`.

10. **Report** — summarise what was implemented in this step, flag anything that was skipped or deferred, and tell the user which step (if any) is next.
